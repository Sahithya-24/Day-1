         <p>Swami Vivekananda 12 January 1863 4 July 1902, born Narendranath Datta , was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher,
         author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure 
         in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,and is the father of modern Indian nationalism
          who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in 
          the late nineteenth century.
         Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion
         and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda 
         extensively toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand knowledge of the living conditions
          of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help them and found a way to travel to the
           United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered 
           his famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to Americans.
            He made such an impression there that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly 
            the greatest figure at the Parliament"</p>
